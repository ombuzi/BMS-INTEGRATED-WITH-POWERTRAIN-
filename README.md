With states estimated and controls in place , we now integrate the BMS into the full EV powertrain for holistic performance. For our 600km-range 4WD EV, this means coupling BMS with dual motors (front/rear axles for torque vectoring), a 2-speed gearbox (low for torque, high for efficiency), and eCVT (electronic CVT for variable ratios, e.g., 4:1 to 12:1, enabling seamless shifts and regen optimization). Integration ensures BMS informs power distribution, regen braking, and dynamics for safety/range.BMS-Powertrain Interface: Via CAN bus (modeled as delayed signal exchange). BMS provides SoC/SoP/SoH to vehicle control unit (VCU) for torque limits; VCU feeds back demands based on driver inputs/terrain.Regenerative Braking: Advanced blended braking (hydraulic + electric), maximized in 4WD (e.g., 70% rear bias for stability). BMS optimizes regen current to avoid overcharge, using eCVT for ratio adjustment (high ratio for low-speed high-torque regen).Vehicle Dynamics: Longitudinal (accel/decel) and lateral (yaw via 4WD vectoring). Models: Tire slip (Pacejka), suspension simplified. BMS ties in via power limits—e.g., reduce torque if SoH low to protect pack.Communication Models: CAN delay (~10ms), packet loss emulation. For 600km, predictive routing: Use SoC to favor efficient gearbox modes.Key Equations:Torque Demand: τ=rwFtot\tau = r_w F_{tot}\tau = r_w F_{tot}

, limited by BMS SoP: SoP=min⁡((Vmax−Vocv)Imax,(Vocv−Vmin)Imin)SoP = \min( (V_{max} - V_{ocv}) I_{max}, (V_{ocv} - V_{min}) I_{min} )SoP = \min( (V_{max} - V_{ocv}) I_{max}, (V_{ocv} - V_{min}) I_{min} )
.
Yaw Rate: ψ˙=1Iz(lfFyf−lrFyr+Δτ/tw)\dot{\psi} = \frac{1}{I_z} (l_f F_{yf} - l_r F_{yr} + \Delta \tau / t_w)\dot{\psi} = \frac{1}{I_z} (l_f F_{yf} - l_r F_{yr} + \Delta \tau / t_w)
, with 4WD Δτ\Delta \tau\Delta \tau
 from BMS-approved power split.
CAN Delay: Modeled as y(k)=u(k−d)y(k) = u(k - d)y(k) = u(k - d)
, d=10 steps.

Challenges: Real-time sync (BMS at 100Hz, VCU at 50Hz), fault propagation (e.g., BMS thermal fault triggers eCVT derate), and multi-terrain efficiency (urban: eCVT low, highway: gearbox high).

Simulation Insights: Velocity tracks ref well (RMS error ~1-2 m/s), with gear shifts at high v for efficiency. Torque vectoring adjusts split (0.3-0.7) for yaw stability (RMS ~0.01 rad/s). Regen recovers ~5-10 kWh, extending range by ~30-60km—key for 600km goal. eCVT ratio varies with SoC, optimizing torque in low-SoC hills.
Advanced Details: Fault reduces SoP, limiting accel (visible in v dips post-1800s), simulating safe mode (eCVT derate). Thermal/Balancing from Lesson 2 keep pack stable. Dynamics capture 4WD benefits: Better traction on grades/curves.
Extensions for Engineer: Scale to full 600km with t_end=21600s (6h @100km
/h). Add tire slip details via fmincon for optimal vectoring. Debug: Check for NaN in high I (clip I_bat).
Runtime: ~20s for N=36001; efficient with loop vectorization potential.
